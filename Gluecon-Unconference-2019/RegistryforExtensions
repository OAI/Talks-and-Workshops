Registry for Extensions - most voted topic

Darrel:
This already exists:
Spec.openapis.org/registry
Can do a PR


Use cases as observed by Emmanuel:
- To start up a proposal: `x-oas-draft-xxx`
- To find what others did, what exists right now, as documentation
	- I.e OAI does not “govern” extensions

Action items:
Darrel: Add Registry to website
Ron/Ted: process to update the registry
Who? Proposed by Steve: Call out to vendors to fill in registry

Draft process as outlined by Ted
3 stage:
1. Vendor - x-vendor-xxx - it’s a list for vendors to add their stuff, encourage them
Steve: ask vendors to add their extensions
3. Commons - collaborative evolution , self-government - e.g. x-rate-limit - encourage community to collaborate
4. Draft as part of OAI process, as part of proposal process: x-oas-draft-xxx
