Query Protocols as a Language feature

Positioning wrt GraphQL, OData, JSON API
- GraphQL over OpenAPI

Darrel:
* Why - to avoid writing resolvers for GraphQL
* Wants complementary spec: Query Plan Spec
* So, given an OpenAPI Schema with links that describe relationships, I can use GraphQL to query HTTP services

[Ask Darrel for his slide, notes]

Useful for:
a. Implementing queries over existing services, regardless of whether they use GraphQL
b. A language for doing composition vs arbitrary code

Ted
Bothered by duality of choice - do I create a REST API or GraphQL API
How do I define my query protocol in OpenAPI - no good answer
Looking for a way to describe a query in a clean way, not worried about the how. Wants to extend OpenAPI.

Steve:
Should have an answer for “how do I do a query API”?

Tina: Difficult to build the ecosystem that GraphQL has so likes Darrel’s approach to reuse what’s available.

Action:
Needs further discussion in OpenAPI
- Should this be part of the spec?
- Should it be an extension language?
- Should OpenAPI express queries in GraphQL?
