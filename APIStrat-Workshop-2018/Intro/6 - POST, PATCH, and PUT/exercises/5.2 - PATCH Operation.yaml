    # Exercise: PATCH Operation
    
    Here, we'll add a PATCH operation to the individual 
    `/taxpayers/{id}` path item to update the state, using a partial 
    representation of the taxpayer object. Only the included properties
    should be updated; other properties should be unchanged.
    
    This PATCH method is a natural complement to the POST method. It
    can also be included in combination with PUT, though PUT and PATCH
    have some overlap; there are situations where a client could use
    either PUT or PATCH. 
    
    1. In the `/taxpayers/{id}` path item, add a new PATCH operation, 
       with a description indicating that it's updating the resource.
       The request body should be a reference to the existing `Taxpayer`
       schema object in `components/schemas`.
       
    2. Set the successful response to use HTTP response code 200.
       The response should include a representation of the updated
       Taxpayer object.
