Engaging Implementors to Adopt OAS

Ted:
Remove barriers to extend the language

We think the new process (proposals) will help
Also the registry

Actions:
- Post about the new proposal process
- Starter page on OAS
	- For users
	- Also a page geared to tooling providers
- Compliance - Steve: When 3.1 comes out, budget to advertise the tools that reasonably comply with the spec by date X - Neal: what other LF projects have done - start with low bar? Hire outsider to 
“Judge”
- Process to get feedback with toolmakers to ensure features are the ones that get used

Steve:
A draft feature does not go into the spec until it has say 2 implementations

Darrel:
Ensure we are getting feedback from tooling vendors, if an upcoming feature is something they see demand for - vetting

Steve:
We should not shy away from compliance, validation, certification 

Steve:
Certification Must Be automated

Darrel/Tina:
More consistent compliance will ultimately drive greater adoption

Jonathan:
Has internal TCK that does that for RAML
